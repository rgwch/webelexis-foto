# webelexis-foto

Take a picture with a mobile device and send it to [Webelexis/Janus](https://github.com/rgwch/webelexis).

This is a very simple [Cordova/PhoneGap](https://cordova.apache.org/) app which runs on Android and iOS Devices. We use it to take pictures of moles and other skin manifestations to monitor changes over time.

## Prerequisites and Setup

The phone must be in the same WLAN as the Janus Server. Enter settings accordingly. Then just hit "Bild aufnehmen" and the mobile lets you take a photo and transmits it immediately to the server.
